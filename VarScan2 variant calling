VarScan2 source page -  https://varscan.sourceforge.net/somatic-calling.html

# Install VarScan 2.3.9
wget https://phoenixnap.dl.sourceforge.net/project/varscan/VarScan.v2.3.9.jar
# Unpack jar file
jar -xvf VarScan.v2.3.9.jar

### Create pileup files using mpileup function
samtools mpileup -f ref/GRCm39.fna sorted_normal.bam >normal.pileup
samtools mpileup -f ref/GRCm39.fna sorted_tumour.bam >tumour.pileup

### Run VarScan for somatic (SNP/ Indel) variant calling 
java -jar VarScan.v2.3.9.jar somatic normal.pileup tumour.pileup \
SSM3_somatic_variants.vcf --output-vcf 1

### Run somatic variant calling function of VarScan2
java -jar VarScan.v2.3.9.jar somatic normal.pileup tumour.pileup SSM3_somatic_variants.vcf --output-vcf 1
Output:
Normal Pileup: normal.pileup
Tumor Pileup: tumour.pileup

2549779018 positions in tumor
2549759102 positions shared in normal
2508088694 had sufficient coverage for comparison
2501280269 were called Reference
0 were mixed SNP-indel calls and filtered
6468234 were called Germline
73083 were called LOH
168546 were called Somatic
98562 were called Unknown
0 were called Variant

### Isolating Calls by Type and Confidence
# The latest release of VarScan includes a new (undocumented) subcommand that will separate a somatic output
#file by somatic_status (Germline, Somatic, LOH). Somatic mutations will further be classified as 
#high-confidence (.hc) or low-confidence (.lc).
